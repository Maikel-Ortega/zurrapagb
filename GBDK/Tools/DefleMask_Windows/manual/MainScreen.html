<span class="rvts15">1: Pattern Matrix/Instrument List</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts22">
In the pattern matrix you can arrange the patterns' positions. It is possible to create different orders for every channel, in this way you can create different loops, repetitions and mixes using all the channels at the same time. The pattern matrix is a sequencer, it will help you to control how your song will evolve trough time:</span>

<br><img border="0" alt hspace="1" vspace="1" src="lib/DefleMask_PatternMatrix.PNG"><br>
<span class="rvts22">The buttons are explained in </span><a class="rvts30" href="Controls.html">Controls</a><span class="rvts22">.</span><br><span class="rvts22"></span><br><span class="rvts22">If the Current System supports instruments and you press the configured key (check out "Controls") or the button over the indexes, the Pattern Matrix will switch into the Instrument List:</span>
<br>

<img border="0" alt hspace="1" vspace="1" src="lib/DefleMask_InstrumentList.PNG">
<br>

<span class="rvts22">When you start a new song, there are no instruments at all, you have to click on "New" in order to create a new instrument.</span><br><span class="rvts22">After it is created, you can change the type by clicking on "FM" or "STD" if the current system supports both "FM" and "STD" instruments, STD instruments are controlled by envelopes generators, and FM instruments are controlled by its FM Registers.<br>
You can enter on the properties of the instruments by clicking on edit button. Inside that subwindow, you can name it and edit its envelopes or FM values, load instruments, save instruments, etc.</span><br><span class="rvts22">If you want a copy of the instrument, you should click "Copy" button, and a copy will be created at the bottom of the list.</span></p>

<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts22">You can press "Del" to delete the bottom instrument.</span><br><span class="rvts22">If the current system supports PCM Samples, a PCM Samples line will appear. You can press "Edit" button in order to load and assign samples to notes. If the system supports samples, check out the system's section.</span></p>
<span class="rvts22">If you want a copy of the instrument, you should click "Copy" button, and a copy will be created at the bottom of the list.</span></p>
<br>
<span class="rvts15">Save/Load Window:</span><br>
<img border="0" alt hspace="1" vspace="1" src="lib/DefleMask_Save_Load_Window.PNG">
<br>

<span class="rvts22">A window like this will popup when you press on a Save or Load button, you can navigate trough subfolders, load files or create more and new folders. Remember that the "Name: " textbox is also used to create a new folder, so you have to select a name and press on "Create Folder" to create it.</span>
<br><br>
<span class="rvts15">Instrument Editor Windows:</span><br>
The instrument editor window in DefleMask is a floating sub window, you can use the side button ">" to switch the position of the window to the right part of the screen, after that you can use the "<" button to move it to the left.<br>
This is very useful while you are editing a song and you want to check the instrument at the same time.<br>
In order to close the window, you have to press the "X" button at the top of the screen.<br>
Because DefleMask is a Multi-System Tracker there are various type of Instrument Editor Windows. Its are explained next.
<br><br>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts26">STD Instruments:</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts25"></span><br><img border="0" width="614" height="460" alt hspace="1" vspace="1" src="lib/SMS_InstrumentEditor.PNG"><br><span class="rvts25"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts25">The STD Instruments are controlled by Macro Generators, you can draw any type of shape using the mouse, you can also copy notes or volume values and paste its inside the Macro, or set a Loop point by clicking in the bottom part of the envelope, you can remove that loop point with a click with the right mouse button. If the current system supports WAVE Channels, you can change the wave selected by the "Selected WAVE" display or by the button in the bottom of the instrument list. Remember that you can use the Arpeggio MACRO/ENVELOPE for the PCM channels too (in order to trigger a sample rapidly).</span></p>
<br>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts26">FM Instruments:</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts25"></span><br><img border="0" width="614" height="460" alt hspace="1" vspace="1" src="lib/Genesis_InstrumentEditor.PNG"><br><span class="rvts25"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts25">The FM Instruments are controlled by FM Registers, you can change its values by using sliders, for more information about the System FM values, check the System's section inside this manual.</span></p>
<br>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts26">WAVETABLE Instruments:</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts25"></span><br><img border="0" width="614" height="460" alt hspace="1" vspace="1" src="lib/PCE_WAVE_InstrumentEditor.png"><br><span class="rvts25"><br></span></p>
Some Systems, for example, the Game Boy, have WAVE Channels, its are edited using the mouse and drawing the shape of the desired wave. You can load and save WaveTables any time. In order to change the current Wavetable selected by the "Selected WAVE" display or by the button in the bottom of the instrument list. Also you can copy volume or note values from the patterns and paste that directly in the graph.
<br><br>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts26">Samples:</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts25"></span><br><img border="0" width="614" height="460" alt hspace="1" vspace="1" src="lib/SamplesEditor.PNG"><br><span class="rvts25"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts25">You can load Wav files into DefleMask in order to use the PCM Capabilites of the current system selected, the wav files must have 16bits of depth.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts25">You can use a max of 12 PCM sample instruments, however, in future versions of DefleMask this limit can be expanded.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts25">You can change the Hz of a loaded sample by clicking on the "+" or "-" buttons for each sample, you can also modify it pitch and amplitude.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts25">When you load the first sample, it is assigned to the C note, the second sample loaded will be assigned to the C# note, and so on.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts25">In other words, you can obtain a full octave of samples, from C to B:</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts25">C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, A#, B.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts25"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts25">You can Preview a sample loaded clicking on "preview" button, or you can use the keyboard.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts25">To replace a loaded sample, simply reload a new sample over the desired one.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts25">To delete a sample, click on the "X". Only the lastest loaded sample can be deleted!, so, if you want to erease the first sample, you will need to erase the others. The samples are stored in a stack.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts25"><br></span></p>
<br>

<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts22"><br></span></p>

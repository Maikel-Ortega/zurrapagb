Deflemask skins

v2 has a better aesthetic but some visibility problems.
v3 has better visibility but I like the colours less.
The differences between the two are only in the Pattern List. Everything else is the same.

This is the ideal working environment for me. Lots of soft blues and greys that don't demand much attention from my eyes. Something to fade into the background.

Special thanks to Delek for the great tracker with continuous support.
